title: About
---

I am an independent software developer in Oakland, California. I use [he/him](https://pronoun.is/he) pronouns. While primarily an iOS developer, I do have other programming interests. You can learn about my [open source work and side projects here](/projects), and you can find a list of my [conference talks here](/speaking).

I am currently working on indie projects, as well as freelancing and contracting for iOS. I also co-host the [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped) podcast. Previously, I have worked at PlanGrid, Instagram, and Rosetta Stone. You can see my [complete CV here](/linkedout). If you would like to work together, [please get in touch](/contact).

More generally, I hope to contribute to a society that values community over hierarchy, [self-determination over capitalist exploitation](https://crimethinc.com/tce), and public ownership over private property.

**Other interests:** reading books, bike touring, trail running, body modification, hook suspension, tea and coffee, cognitive science, moral philosophy, avant-garde art, punk/hardcore/metal, worker power.
