I'm an independent iOS and macOS developer, and [open source contributor]({{ site.data.social.github }}).
I [write here]({% link blog.md %}), take [notes here](https://jessesquires.github.io/TIL/), occasionally [speak at conferences]({% link speaking.md %}), and work on many [different projects]({% link projects.md %}).
You can learn more [about me here]({% link about.md %}).
If you appreciate my work, consider [becoming a sponsor]({% link sponsor.md %}) or [buying my apps](https://www.hexedbits.com).
I'm currently focusing on personal projects, while doing contract work for various clients.
