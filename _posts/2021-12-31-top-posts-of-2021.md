title: Top posts of 2021
---

To finish off this year, here are my most popular posts of 2021. You can find previous years [here under the #top-posts tag]({{ "top-posts" | tag_url }}). As you likely know, I use [GoatCounter for analytics]({% post_url 2020-05-08-simple-private-opensource-analytics-with-goatcounter %}) for my site. (You should [check it out](https://www.goatcounter.com)!) All of my analytics data is [publicly available]({{ site.stats_url }}) so you can view it too.

You can view [the data here][stats-link] for this year's top posts, which is filtered to display site visits for all of 2021 and only for posts written in 2021 (that is, URLs matching `/blog/2021/`). If you'd like to browse posts beyond the top 10, you [can use the same link][stats-link]. To see everything I've written in 2021, you can [browse the archive]({% link archive-home.html %}).

I'm always surprised and fascinated by which posts become the most popular. It feels so unpredictable. There's one honorable mention that I'd like to highlight --- my favorite post from this year, [*Yo, where's my Juicero? A survey of talent in Silicon Valley*]({% post_url 2021-11-30-yo-wheres-my-juicero %}). This satirical essay unfortunately did not land in the top 10, but it did make the top 20 as the 19th most popular piece this year.
