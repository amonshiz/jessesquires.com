Previously, I [wrote about Time Machine "error 45"]({% post_url_absolute 2020-07-17-time-machine-error-45 %}), an obscure bug in macOS Catalina. I still have no idea what was causing backups to fail, nor what "error 45" means. However, I am happy to report that _I think_ this issue has been fixed in Big Sur.

I upgraded the same machine experiencing this issue &mdash; a 2020 Intel MacBook Pro &mdash; to Big Sur a little over a month ago. So far, so good. Time Machine has been working consistently and reliably. No more "error 45" failures. 

I hope the error does not return, but if it does, I will update this post.
