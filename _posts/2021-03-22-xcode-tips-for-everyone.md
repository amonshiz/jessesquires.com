title: Xcode tips for everyone
---

Lately, it feels like every few days someone is sharing a new Xcode tip on Twitter or on their blog. They range from hidden settings to features I simply never knew about. I started saving links and planned to add a new "Xcode tips" section to my [TIL repo on GitHub](https://github.com/jessesquires/til) to reference later. But as I started, I realized that the resulting markdown file would not be easily discoverable or shareable. I thought, wouldn't it be nice if the iOS and macOS developer community had a single place to find and share Xcode tips?

<!--excerpt-->

So, that is what I did instead! Say hello to [Xcode Tips](https://xcode-tips.github.io), a resource for the community to find **and share** their Xcode workflows, tips, tricks, and optimizations. The code for the site [is on GitHub](https://github.com/Xcode-Tips/xcode-tips.github.io) under the [Xcode-Tips organization](https://github.com/Xcode-Tips/). I have started off with a couple dozen tips, but I know there are many more out there.

My goal was to get a site set up and running as quickly as possible, and to make it as effortless as possible for anyone to submit their own tips &mdash; which is as easy as [sending a pull request](https://github.com/Xcode-Tips/xcode-tips.github.io/pulls). For now, it is a basic [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site at `xcode-tips.github.io` that consists of a single markdown file. This allowed me to focus on content rather than web development. There is certainly some room for improvement (and contributions are welcome!) regarding the site itself, but most importantly, it is functional. If the project becomes popular, I might register a cool custom domain.

My long-term goal is for this to be an entirely community-maintained project, because I do not have much free time to devote to this project specifically. However, I do not expect it to be much effort to maintain. I think we can do it! Anyone who submits a pull request (or sends me an email) will be added to the GitHub [organization](https://github.com/Xcode-Tips/) to facilitate contributions, reviewing future pull requests, etc.

I hope the community finds this useful. If you have a tip, please send it over!
