title: "Reading Notes: The Abolition of Work"
---

[Bob Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Black) published his essay _The Abolition of Work_ in 1985, though it is as prescient as ever. You can find it freely available [at The Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bob-black-the-abolition-of-work). As you might anticipate, it is a critique and criticism of work. The first sentence of the essay is _"No one should ever work."_ &mdash; a sentiment I fully endorse and which I suspect the careerist workaholics in Silicon Valley will shun as sacrilege.

But, if like me, you think working sucks, know that you are not alone. We (the workers of the world) spend _the majority_ of our lives working for corporations that couldn't care less about our wellbeing. Anyone who has ever worked knows this is true. Even in so-called "good jobs" we still don't get enough time-off (only 3 weeks **per year**?!), nor do we get paid enough in comparison to corporate executives who cannot provide a justification for why they deserve such outsized compensation.

Work is [literally killing people](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57139434) &mdash; up to nearly 1 million per year. As [the BBC reported](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57139434):

> Long working hours are killing hundreds of thousands of people a year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The first global study of its kind showed 745,000 people died in 2016 from stroke and heart disease due to long hours.
> [...] The WHO also said the trend may worsen due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Honestly, the majority of my time working in the tech industry has filled me with disillusionment. I often feel entirely disconnected from the work I'm doing, from the corporation I'm working for, and especially from whatever vacant and futile "company mission statement" executives workshopped that year to placate and motivate us. However, this is a topic for a future post.

And with that, I'll leave you with my highlights from _The Abolition of Work_.

> Work is the source of nearly all the misery in the world. Almost any evil you’d care to name comes from working or from living in a world designed for work. In order to stop suffering, we have to stop working.

> Play isn’t passive. Doubtless we all need a lot more time for sheer sloth and slack than we ever enjoy now, regardless of income or occupation, but once recovered from employment-induced exhaustion nearly all of us want to act.

{% include break.html %}

> Liberals say we should end employment discrimination. I say we should end employment.

{% include break.html %}

> Unions and management agree that we ought to sell the time of our lives in exchange for survival, although they haggle over the price. Marxists think we should be bossed by bureaucrats. Libertarians think we should be bossed by businessmen. Feminists don’t care which form bossing takes so long as the bosses are women. Clearly these ideology-mongers have serious differences over how to divvy up the spoils of power. Just as clearly, none of them have any objection to power as such and all of them want to keep us working.

> The alternative to work isn’t just idleness. [...] Leisure is nonwork for the sake of work. Leisure is the time spent recovering from work and in the frenzied but hopeless attempt to forget about work. Many people return from vacation so beat that they look forward to returning to work so they can rest up. The main difference between work and leisure is that work at least you get paid for your alienation and enervation.

{% include break.html %}

> My minimum definition of work is _forced labor_, that is, compulsory production. Both elements are essential. Work is production enforced by economic or political means, by the carrot or the stick. (The carrot is just the stick by other means.) But not all creation is work. Work is never done for its own sake, it’s done on account of some product or output that the worker (or, more often, somebody else) gets out of it.

{% include break.html %}

> _All_ industrial (and office) workers are employees and under the sort of surveillance which ensures servility.

{% include break.html %}

> This is the real world of work: a world of bureaucratic blundering, of sexual harassment and discrimination, of bonehead bosses exploiting and scapegoating their subordinates who — by any rational-technical criteria — should be calling the shots. But capitalism in the real world subordinates the rational maximization of productivity and profit to the exigencies of organizational control.

{% include break.html %}

> Play is just the opposite. Play is always voluntary. What might otherwise be play is work if it’s forced. This is axiomatic.

{% include break.html %}

> Work makes a mockery of freedom. The official line is that we all have rights and live in a democracy. Other unfortunates who aren’t free like we are have to live in police states. These victims obey orders or-else, no matter how arbitrary. The authorities keep them under regular surveillance. State bureaucrats control even the smaller details of everyday life. The officials who push them around are answerable only to higher-ups, public or private. Either way, dissent and disobedience are punished. Informers report regularly to the authorities. All this is supposed to be a very bad thing.

> And so it is, although it is nothing but a description of the modern workplace.

> And let’s pretend that work isn’t as boring and tiring and humiliating as we all know it really is. Even then, work would still make a mockery of all humanistic and democratic aspirations, just because it usurps so much of our time. Socrates said that manual laborers make bad friends and bad citizens because they have no time to fulfill the responsibilities of friendship and citizenship. He was right. Because of work, no matter what we do we keep looking at our watches. The only thing “free” about so-called free time is that it doesn’t cost the boss anything. Free time is mostly devoted to getting ready for work, going to work, returning from work, and recovering from work. Free time is a euphemism for the peculiar way labor as a factor of production not only transports itself at its own expense to and from the workplace but assumes primary responsibility for its own maintenance and repair.

> Directly or indirectly, work will kill most of the people who read these words. Between 14,000 and 25,000 workers are killed annually in this country on the job. Over two million are disabled. Twenty to twenty-five million are injured every year. And these figures are based on a very conservative estimation of what constitutes a work-related injury. Thus they don’t count the half million cases of occupational disease every year.

> To this augmented body-count must be added the victims of auto-industrial pollution and work-induced alcoholism and drug addiction. Both cancer and heart disease are modern afflictions normally traceable, directly, or indirectly, to work.

> Even before Reagan and the Supreme Court stifled it, OSHA was a farce. At previous and (by current standards) generous Carter-era funding levels, a workplace could expect a random visit from an OSHA inspector once every 46 years.

> It is now possible to abolish work and replace it, insofar as it serves useful purposes, with a multitude of new kinds of free activities. To abolish work requires going at it from two directions, quantitative and qualitative. On the one hand, on the quantitative side, we have to cut down massively on the amount of work being done. At present most work is useless or worse and we should simply get rid of it. On the other hand — and I think this is the crux of the matter and the revolutionary new departure — we have to take what useful work remains and transform it into a pleasing variety of game-like and craft-like pastimes, indistinguishable from other pleasurable pastimes, except that they happen to yield useful end-products. Surely that shouldn’t make them less enticing to do. Then all the artificial barriers of power and property could come down. Creation could become recreation. And we could all stop being afraid of each other.

> [...] most work serves the unproductive purposes of commerce or social control. Right off the bat we can liberate tens of millions of salesmen, soldiers, managers, cops, stockbrokers, clergymen, bankers, lawyers, teachers, landlords, security guards, ad-men and everyone who works for them.

> Forty percent of the workforce are white-collar workers, most of whom have some of the most tedious and idiotic jobs ever concocted. Entire industries, insurance and banking and real estate for instance, consist of nothing but useless paper-shuffling. It is no accident that the “tertiary sector,” the service sector, is growing while the “secondary sector” (industry) stagnates and the “primary sector” (agriculture) nearly disappears. Because work is unnecessary except to those whose power it secures, workers are shifted from relatively useful to relatively useless occupations as a measure to assure public order.

> That’s why you can’t go home just because you finish early. They want your _time_, enough of it to make you theirs, even if they have no use for most of it.
