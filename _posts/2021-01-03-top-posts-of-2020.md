title: Top posts of 2020
---

Earlier this year, I decided to [re-implement analytics for my site]({% post_url_absolute 2020-05-08-simple-private-opensource-analytics-with-goatcounter %}) after discovering a viable privacy-aware (and open-source!) alternative to the user-hostile spyware garbage that we call [Google Analytics]({% post_url_absolute 2018-04-22-removing-google-analytics-too %}). I have really enjoyed using [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) and I highly recommend it. Now that I have this data, I thought it would be fun to share my top 10 most popular posts in 2020.

<!--excerpt-->

All of my analytics data is [publicly available]({{ site.stats_url }}) so you can view it too. You might notice that the data begins in April 2020 &mdash; that's when I implemented GoatCounter. Next year, I'll be able to filter by the entire year. 

I have decided to create two separate lists because "top posts of 2020" could be interpreted in multiple ways. There is one list for the most popular posts *that I wrote* in 2020 and one list for the *most viewed posts* during the year 2020. I think it will be more interesting to see how **all posts** rise and fall in popularity over time. For example, one of my most viewed posts for this year is from **2015**!

1. [Time Machine error 45]({% post_url_absolute 2020-07-17-time-machine-error-45 %})

The #1 post was most popular because it made it to the [top of HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24490326) and was [linked by The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439674/ios-14-developers-iphone-surprise-release-golden-master-beta-development). I did not anticipate either of those things happening. Also, it really skews the page view graphs on GoatCounter. Another interesting note is that 40% of these top posts were linked in [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com). Anecdotally, I would have told you that getting linked in the newsletter drives a substantial amount of traffic to your site, but it is interesting to confirm just how significant an influence it has on the iOS community. (And I think Dave continues to do a great job with it!)

It is really interesting to see which older posts the iOS community is still reading &mdash; or, which posts are surfaced by search engines. In particular, I think *"Swift enumerations and equatable"* (#6) is interesting to see here. I think this emphasizes how unintuitive is it to write `Equatable` conformances by hand for enums that have associated values. However, as of Swift 4.1 ([SE-0185](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0185-synthesize-equatable-hashable.md)) the compiler will synthesize `Equatable` conformance for you, so it is odd to see this post is still popular multiple years later. For the other two older posts &mdash; *"How to run sysdiagnose on iOS"* and *"Why optional closures in Swift are escaping"* &mdash; those remain top hits on search engines.

Finally, for what it's worth, Time Machine is **still failing** with error 45.
