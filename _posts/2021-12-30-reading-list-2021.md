title: A list of books I read in 2021
---

Here are the books I read this year, in 2021, the worst year of the century so far. You can find previous years [here under the #reading-list tag]({{ "reading-list" | tag_url }}). Similar to [last year]({% post_url 2020-12-30-reading-list-2020 %}), I'm a bit disappointed in myself for continuing my trend of reading _even less_ than the previous year. But I'm trying to not be so hard on myself. After two years of a fucking pandemic, I'll consider literally anything an accomplishment --- so managing to find the focus to finish each of these books is something for which to be grateful.

[Last year I wrote]({% post_url 2020-12-30-reading-list-2020 %}):

> Still, I read 15 books in total, which isn't bad. However, I had planned on reading about double that amount. Ha! I guess my list is set for 2021, which I hope will be much less of a fucking disaster.

It's funny to read that now, haha. I expect 2022 to be just as much of a shit show as ever, as I continue to learn how to cope with this new world. Anyway, I hope to read more in 2022. I still have ambitious stacks of books from 2020 to get through, and my list continues to grow. The good news is that it _should_ be easy to read more than this next year.

So without further ado, here's the list. Per usual, there is no particular order. You should be able to find all of these [at your local indie bookstore](https://www.indiebound.org), because fuck Amazon. I hope you discover something new!
