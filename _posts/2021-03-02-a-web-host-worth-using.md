title: A web host worth using

---

I've written [about my web host before]({{ site_url}}/blog/tags/nearlyfreespeech/). I've used [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net) for years. It's very "bare bones", very DIY, and very no-bullshit. I highly recommend them, especially if you only need to host a static site. It is so inexpensive you could say it's _nearly_ free.

A few weeks ago, they published [a blog post](https://blog.nearlyfreespeech.net/2021/01/19/free-speech-in-2021/), shortly after the riot at the US capitol, that made me appreciate them even more.

[**@jdw** writes](https://blog.nearlyfreespeech.net/2021/01/19/free-speech-in-2021/):

In an industry controlled by complacent ([overt](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosiegray/peter-thiel-donald-trump-white-nationalist-support) and covert) [white supremacist](https://news.techworkerscoalition.org/2020/10/16/issue-12/) CEOs and "investors" who can't be bothered [to regulate their own companies](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56168844) in any way or [take a stance on literally anything](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44883743) unless doing so yields higher profits, a statement like this is shockingly refreshing to read. It emphasizes the [abysmally depressing](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/02/amazon-ftc-pay-flex-drivers-stolen-tips.html) state of the tech industry which continues to pursue its [parasitic attack](https://news.techworkerscoalition.org/2020/10/30/issue-13/) on [human progress](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/10/09/apple-forces-telegram-to-close-channels-run-by-belarus-protestors/) and the [general](https://ffwd.medium.com/all-of-youtube-not-just-the-algorithm-is-a-far-right-propaganda-machine-29b07b12430) [wellbeing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/amazon-workers-protest-unsafe-grueling-conditions-warehouse) of society.

Anyway, if you want to move your blog (or something else) off of Amazon's servers or whatever other user-hostile, anti-labor, pro-surveillance host you are currently using, check out NearlyFreeSpeech. You'll probably save some money, too.
