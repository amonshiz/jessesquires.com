[Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped) recorded two episodes in the Podcast studio at WWDC this year. We had [Greg Heo](https://gregheo.com) on to [talk about our reactions to the announcements](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/154581) from the Keynote and Platforms State of the Union. Then we [discussed Swift 4.2 and beyond](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/154699) with [Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek).

<!--excerpt-->

Ted is the Project Lead for [Swift.org](https://swift.org), he manages the Languages and Runtimes team at Apple, and he's also the original author of the Clang Static Analyzer. Greg works at [Topology Eyewear](https://www.topologyeyewear.com) and writes about Swift at [SwiftUnboxed.com](https://swiftunboxed.com).

Both are great episodes. We all had a ton of fun doing them. Our thanks goes out to Greg and Ted for joining us!

Let us know what you think!
