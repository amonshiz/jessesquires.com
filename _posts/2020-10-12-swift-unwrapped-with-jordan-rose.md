title: Swift Unwrapped with Jordan Rose
---

In today's [episode of Swift Unwrapped](https://swiftunwrapped.github.io/episodes/1DMLbJg5/), JP and I had [Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN) on the show to discuss his [recent blog posts](https://belkadan.com/blog/tags/swift-runtime/) on implementing the Swift runtime in Swift.

<!--excerpt-->

We diverged from the main topic a number of times, and many of those tangents were the most fascinating parts of the conversation for me. It's a shame we couldn't dive deeper, but then you'd have a 3-hour podcast to sit through. It's a great episode and I think you'll learn a lot. You can [listen here](https://swiftunwrapped.github.io/episodes/1DMLbJg5/).
