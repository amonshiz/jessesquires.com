  refactoring your code, or shipping features quickly. Lastly, Jesse is an extremely clear and direct communicator.
  I never had to wonder what he was working on because he took care to keep the team up to date."

  app for learning languages. Jesse is exceptionally knowledgeable about the platform and consistently applies
  that background to make the codebase better for both our developers and our learners. On top of that,

  position: Engineering Manager
  year: 2019-2021
  testimonial: "Immediate impact. As a manager, that was my initial assessment of Jesse after
  shortly joining us on RxSaver in a part time iOS role. Over time that assessment proved naive and simplistic,
  but no less true. Jesse's expertise and experience naturally brings a velocity and throughput lift that any
  organization will feel and value greatly. However, Jesse's passion to make iOS code bases better,
  coupled with his ability to help shape direction through respectful sharing of nuanced opinion,
  has had a much deeper and longer lasting effect on RxSaver's iOS app and team culture.
  As a manager, I couldn't be more impressed."

  year: 2013-2015
  testimonial: "Industrious, talented, quick learner â€” all phrases that come to mind when I think about Jesse.
  As his manager I worked closely with him, and got to examine up close the code he wrote, and the systems he designed,
  which were always high quality. He has a knack for software development, and he constantly impressed me with
  his well-designed solutions that he quickly and effortlessly implemented. His peers highly respected his work,
  and would often seek out his feedback. They loved working with him â€” he made them better developers, and he was
  always good company to be around. I greatly enjoyed my time working with him, and would love to again.
  Any team would be lucky to have him."

  testimonial: "Aside from his great sense of humor and impeccable taste in coffee,
  Jesse is one of the most talented software engineers I have worked with at Rosetta Stone.
  This is a person who truly believes in giving back to the development community and raising the bar for
  developers where ever he goes. Whip smart, quick, and an incredible work ethic make him someone you want in your team.
  Trust me, the man can make one minute rice in 55 seconds. Hire him if the chance opens up and thank me later.
  He's that damn good."
