    description: "Visiting Undergraduate Research Fellowship (VURF) in Cognitive Science.
    Awarded to only one or two students each year. I took graduate-level courses, earning a 3.60 GPA.
    I worked on the following research projects."
    bullets:
      - "**Advisor: Dr. Randy Beer.** Researched evolutionary algorithms, evolutionary
        robotics and dynamical systems approaches to behavior and cognition. Developed
        software to support the evolution of model agents controlled by continuous-time
        recurrent neural networks that exhibited minimally cognitive behavior."

      - "**Advisor: Dr. Colin Allen.** Joined the [Indiana Philosophy Ontology (InPhO)
        Project](https://www.inphoproject.org) development team in building new and improving
        existing mechanisms for facilitating expert feedback in digital philosophy that
        utilize crowd-sourcing techniques in order to improve the InPhO model. The InPhO
        Project is an attempt to model the discipline of philosophy, which leverages expert
        knowledge by augmenting it with machine reasoning."

      - "**Advisor: Dr. Rob Goldstone.** Developed an iOS app to facilitate research in
        collective decision-making. The app is a game that prompts users to answer various
        trivia questions, after which all responses are displayed and each user has the
        opportunity to re-evaluate his or her answer based on the groupâ€™s collective response."

      - "Developed a trail mapping application for Android OS that uses only sensor data,
        not GPS, to map trails in real time."
      - "Produced a research paper and poster on the project."
      - "Awarded 1st place in the REU Poster Competition."
      - "Presented at Math, Engineering and Science Conference (MESCON) 2012 at University of Evansville."
